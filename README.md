# Linear Regression to Predict Airbnb Cost
Project 3: Linear Regression to Predict Airbnb Cost
We've learned several different parts of Scikit-learn and Plotly in week 3 material. For this week's project, we applied what we learned and implemented a new algorithm on the Airbnb Amsterdam data.

## Project Overview
In this project, we are using Scikit-learn and Plotly to create our own model trained to predict Airbnb Cost in function of:
- How many amenities does the listing have?
- How many people does the listing accommodate?
- Is the listing instantly bookable?
We worked with Google Colab to write and run our Python code and visualize the dataset using Streamlit.

## Data Visualization
We run the model created in this week project with Streamlit app to predict the price in function of the inputs given to the model.

### Streamlit Visualization
We are using Streamlit to create and host our interactive visualization.

## Course material week 3 summary
- What is Machine Learning?
  - Uses data to predict outcomes.
  - Example: Telling if an image is an apple.

- Types of Machine Learning:
  - Classification: Predicts categories (e.g., apple or not).
  - Regression: Predicts numbers (e.g., stock prices).

- Why Data Matters:
  - Good data is essential for accurate predictions.
  - Bad data results in poor model performance.

- Machine Learning Steps:
  - Collect Data: Gather information to use.
  - Clean Data: Prepare data for use.
  - Explore Data: Look for patterns.
  - Build Model: Create the prediction tool.
  - Deploy Model: Use it on new data.
  - Improve Model: Update with new data.

- Supervised Learning:
  - Uses labeled data (e.g., labeled images of apples).
  - Scikit-Learn: A library to build models.

- Preparing Data:
  - Split Data: Divide into training and testing sets.
  - One-Hot Encoding: Convert categories to binary format.

- Visualizing Data:
  - Use tools like Plotly for interactive charts.
  - Find relationships with scatter plots, histograms, etc.

- Evaluating Models:
  - R-Squared: Measures feature correlation.
  - Avoid Overfitting: Ensure the model works well with new data.
